# SMART-Code
Sequential Modeling for Assembly-Planning via Reinforcement-Learning Techniques


## Installation
You can recreate the python environment used to run these files via:
```
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```

Similiarily, using a standard Python 3 installation, you can also use:
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r pipRequirements.txt
```


## Running
A few example scenarios are provided inside the Pythin Notebooks. If one of these is ran, along with the helper functions preceding it, the corresponding Graph-Exploration or Learning-Based methods can be deployed on that scenario.
